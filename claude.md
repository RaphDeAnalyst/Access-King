I want you to build a demo business website for a solar energy company called Access King Solar. The goal is to impress the CEO of a real solar brand, so make it professional and business-like.

Requirements:

Tech Stack: Use HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript (Bootstrap or Tailwind for styling if possible).

Make it mobile-friendly (responsive).

Keep the design clean, modern, and professional.

Pages to Include (Demo-Ready):

Home Page: Hero banner with slogan like “Powering Nigeria with Reliable Solar Energy”. Call-to-action button: “Get a Quote”.

About Us Page: Short company story, mission statement, why they are trusted.

Products/Services Page: Showcase solar panels, inverters, batteries, installation services. Each product should have an image placeholder, description, and “Enquire Now” button that links to WhatsApp.

Contact Page: Phone number, email, physical address (use dummy Lagos/Alaba address), Google Map embed (optional), and a contact form.

Header & Footer:

Header: Company logo (use a placeholder), navigation menu.

Footer: Quick links, contact info, WhatsApp button.

WhatsApp Integration:

Add a floating WhatsApp chat button on all pages (link to https://wa.me/234XXXXXXXXXX).

SEO Basics (Demo):

Use meta tags (title, description, keywords).

Example title: “Access King Solar – Solar Panels, Inverters & Clean Energy Solutions in Nigeria”.

Example description: “We provide high-quality solar products and installation services across Nigeria. Affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy for homes and businesses.”

Call-to-Action (CTA):

On Home Page: “Request a Free Quote Today”.

On Products Page: “Buy Now via WhatsApp”.

Design Guidelines:

Colors: Use solar-themed palette (green, yellow, dark blue).

Fonts: Clean, modern (like Open Sans, Roboto, or Montserrat).

Use stock solar images as placeholders (from Unsplash or Pexels).

Extras (Optional, but Nice):

A testimonial slider with 2–3 fake testimonials (“Access King Solar helped me reduce my power bills by 70%”).

A statistics section: “10+ Years in Business | 500+ Clients | 1000+ Solar Panels Installed”.

Deliverables:

A fully functional static website with 4 pages (Home, About, Products, Contact).

Mobile-friendly, clean design.

Dummy content tailored to a Nigerian solar company.

Easy to demo locally in a browser (no backend needed).
